## TL;DR:

I maintain a DevOps blog on Medium [4th Coffee](https://medium.com/4th-coffee). You can [subscribe by email](https://medium.com/subscribe/@IronCore864).

If you are interested, read my [project portfolio](/portfolio/).

Recently, I've been working on a digest of the rust book. [Stay tuned](https://rust-book-digest.guotiexin.com/).

## A Brief Introduction to Tiexin Guo

Hello world, and this is Tiexin Guo. I'm a software engineer.

I had been working in the EU for the past five years; I relocated back to China in the middle of 2021. Currently I live in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, but I prefer to think myself as a citizen of the world.

Now I work as a Senior DevOps expert at [Merico](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/merico), and I'm the PMC Chair of the [open-source project DevStream](https://github.com/devstream-io/devstream).

Before that, I was a senior DevOps consultant at AWS, and I am an [AWS certified solutions architect â€“ professional](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/26bd12d1-296a-4282-b676-6ae431eb9502?source=linked_in_profile).

I'm one of the co-founders and the CTO (fully remote) of a cryptocurrency start-up named MSER Limited based in Shanghai, China. It's running smoothly now, without the need for my intervention.

I'm also an guest expert of [GitGuardian](https://blog.gitguardian.com), and [devops.com](https://devops.com/accelerate-your-sdlc-with-devsecops/).

## Experiences

I majored in computer science and technology at [Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University) (best in China and Asia, 15th in the world; and I'm honored that it ranked No.1 in the world in 2019 according to U.S. News & World Report).

Upon graduation, I started my career as a full-stack engineer (well, back then, the term "full-stack" hadn't been invented). Over the years, I mainly used Python and Golang, but I've also got quite some experience in Node/React/Angular, Java, PHP, C, Perl, and last but not least, Shell, of course.

After eight years of a full-stack career, I transitioned into the DevOps / SRE / Cloud Architect realm, at which time, coincidentally, I relocated from China to Europe.

Over the years, I have worked in various types of companies, including state-owned companies, global IT giants, local and international start-ups, and consulting companies. I have also worked in many business fields, including financing, automotive, insurance, logistic, mobile app market, software, cloud, etc.

I'm pretty into the cloud, DevOps, and agile. I grew more and more interested in this field, especially after I had some successful experience in cloud migration, DevOps transformation, agile transformation, and agile improvement. That's why I have been doing it for the past five years.

## More Rambling

I have been a leader and working in a globally distributed team setup since 2013.

But I'm not the kind of team lead who sits behind his desk and only writes documents and creates Jira tasks; I'm a very hands-on person who leads by example. I code on a day-to-day basis, and I spend more than 50% of my time hands-on.

I am very experienced in hiring, interviewing, scaling teams, and creating an engineering culture. In 2018 and 2019 alone, I interviewed over 200 candidates for engineering roles.

I believe in sharing knowledge and enabling other team members. I share knowledge internally inside the team and across teams constantly, and I love writing blogs. Sometimes I write articles on Cloud/DevOps topics and post them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@IronCore864); please have a look and if it interests you, please like, comment, and subscribe. You can also subscribe via email [here](https://medium.com/subscribe/@IronCore864).

I frequently do presentations and demonstrations with customers, and the audiences are mainly C-level executives. I have also been invited to give talks at local and international meet-ups.
