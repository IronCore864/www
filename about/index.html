Stay tuned.\nIf you are interested in the non-tech aspect of me, follow me on my Flickr.\nA Brief Introduction to Tiexin Guo Hello world, and this is Tiexin Guo. I’m a software engineer.\nI had been working in the EU for the past five years; I relocated back to China in the middle of 2021. Currently I live in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, but I prefer to think myself as a citizen of the world.\nNow I work as a Senior DevOps expert at Merico, and I’m the PMC Chair of the open-source project DevStream.\nBefore that, I was a senior DevOps consultant at AWS, and I am an AWS certified solutions architect – professional.\nI’m one of the co-founders and the CTO (fully remote) of a cryptocurrency start-up named MSER Limited based in Shanghai, China. It’s running smoothly now, without the need for my intervention.\nI’m also an guest expert of GitGuardian, and devops.com.\nExperiences I majored in computer science and technology at Tsinghua University (best in China and Asia, 15th in the world; and I’m honored that it ranked No.1 in the world in 2019 according to U.S. News \u0026 World Report).\nUpon graduation, I started my career as a full-stack engineer (well, back then, the term “full-stack” hadn’t been invented). Over the years, I mainly used Python and Golang, but I’ve also got quite some experience in Node/React/Angular, Java, PHP, C, Perl, and last but not least, Shell, of course.\nAfter eight years of a full-stack career, I transitioned into the DevOps / SRE / Cloud Architect realm, at which time, coincidentally, I relocated from China to Europe.\nOver the years, I have worked in various types of companies, including state-owned companies, global IT giants, local and international start-ups, and consulting companies. I have also worked in many business fields, including financing, automotive, insurance, logistic, mobile app market, software, cloud, etc.\nI’m pretty into the cloud, DevOps, and agile. I grew more and more interested in this field, especially after I had some successful experience in cloud migration, DevOps transformation, agile transformation, and agile improvement. That’s why I have been doing it for the past five years.\nMore Rambling I have been a leader and working in a globally distributed team setup since 2013.\nBut I’m not the kind of team lead who sits behind his desk and only writes documents and creates Jira tasks; I’m a very hands-on person who leads by example. I code on a day-to-day basis, and I spend more than 50% of my time hands-on.\nI am very experienced in hiring, interviewing, scaling teams, and creating an engineering culture. In 2018 and 2019 alone, I interviewed over 200 candidates for engineering roles.\nI believe in sharing knowledge and enabling other team members. I share knowledge internally inside the team and across teams constantly, and I love writing blogs. Sometimes I write articles on Cloud/DevOps topics and post them on Medium; please have a look and if it interests you, please like, comment, and subscribe. You can also subscribe via email here.\nI frequently do presentations and demonstrations with customers, and the audiences are mainly C-level executives. I have also been invited to give talks at local and international meet-ups.\nLinks For more details on my educational and professional background and experience, refer to my CV and my LinkedIn profile.\nIn my spare time, I do some open-source projects. Check them out on my GitHub; feel free to copy-paste anything if needed. One of the projects is a Chrome plugin that has more than 2000 proud users in Europe.\nIn my personal, non-programming daily life, I like road trips, driving cars, camping, hiking, and photography.
